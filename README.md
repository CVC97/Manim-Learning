# Learning Manim

Manim (**Ma**thematical **Anim**ations) is the *Python* library developed by Grant Sanderson for his Youtube-Channel *3Blue1Brown*. Even though there are probably unlimited tutorials about the library online, I have decided to come up with some own jupyter-notebooks that (hopefully) help in understanding the fundamentals of manim:

0. `Setting Up Manim:` Simply how to use manim (locally).
1. `Static Scenes:` The (by far) longest notebook. It introduces the geometry of a manim scene and offers an overview about the existing manim objects and the ways to place them.
2. `Dynamic Scenes:` To implement physics or math, quantitatively moving objects around is essential and that is what this notebook is trying to explain. The notebook itself is very short, but the tools very important.
3. `Object Orientation in Manim:` It is possible to create own manim objects to improve the structuring of your code. Everything works without object orientation, but I like using custom classes as a personal preference, so I included it here.
